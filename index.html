        <h1>GIRAFES vs SEA</h1>
        <section>
          <h2>
            Help the Going Giraffes crew and its captain defeat the evils of the
            sea with math!
          </h2>
          <p>
            Fill the empty spaces after the equal sign ("=") with the correct
            result to drive the deadly animals away!
          </p>
          <p>
            You will start with 100 hit points (HP) and if any animal reaches
            the ship, it will lose HP!
          </p>
          <p>
            If your ship's HP reaches 0, the ship will drown and you'll lose...
          </p>
          <p>
            Each animal has its own strength and speed values that will be determined
            by how hard the math problem is!
          </p>
          <p>
            Dumb animals are fast but deal a low amount damage and are easily
            scared away with simple math,<br />
            while intelligent ones are slower but deal a lot more damage and are
            not that easily scared!
          </p>
          <p>Good luck!</p>
